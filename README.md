## Drowsiness_detection
This is a system which can detect the drowsiness of the driver using CNN - Python, OpenCV. The aim of this is system to reduce the number of accidents on the road by detecting the drowsiness of the driver and warning them using an alarm.
## The Dataset
The dataset which was used is a subnet of a dataset from(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dheerajperumandla/drowsiness-dataset)<br />
it has 4 folder which are <br />1) Closed_eyes - having 726 pictures<br />
                          2) Open_eyes - having 726 pictures<br />
                          3) Yawn - having 725 pictures<br />
                          4) no_yawn - having 723 pictures<br />
